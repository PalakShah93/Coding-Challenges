Challenge: 30

Given an integer, print the next smallest and next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation

Example:
Input: 10 
Output: 
Smallest: 17 (10001)
Largest: 20 (10001)
Explaination: Input's binary representation is: 1010 and then 17 and 20's representation is  10001 and 10001. And no. of 1s are exactly 2 for all.
