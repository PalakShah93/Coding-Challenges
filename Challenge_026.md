Challenge: 26

Find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents.
You can use standard American denominations, that is, 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, and 25¢.

For example, given n = 16, return 3 since we can make it with a 10¢, a 5¢, and a 1¢.

Follow Up: What if there were limits set on no. of each coins available. For example of there were no 10¢ hence the result will be 4 and not three.
