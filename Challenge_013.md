Challenge: 13

Write a program that divides an integer (Whole number) into two sub integers which are:

- Less than the given whole number 
- Does not contain a digit 4
- And should sum up to the given whole number 

For Example:
Input: 10
Output: 5 5
Explanation: [5 5] is small than [10] and it sums up to [10] and does not contain a digit 4. Output can be other than  [5 5], i.e. [8 2] or [7 3] e.t.c but it cannot be [6 4] as it contains 4.

Input 44
Output: 22 22
Explanation: Input can contain a digit four, but the output should not contain digit 4. Other combination could be [24 20] - but this is not allowed as '24' contains digit '4' in it.
