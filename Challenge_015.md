Challenge: 15

The rabbit can hop up one step at a time to reach the top, or he can hop up two steps at a time. 

How many different combinations of hops are there for n steps. Write an algorithm to calculate the number of hop combinations for n steps.

Example:
Input: 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
1-1-1-1 = 4 
2-1-1 = 4 
1-2-1 = 4 
1-1-2 = 4 
2-2 = 4
So for 4 steps, there are 5 possible different combinations of 1-2 hops to reach the top.
