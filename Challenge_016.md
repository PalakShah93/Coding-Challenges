Challenge: 16

Collatz sequence:
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n → n/2 (when n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (when n is odd)

Write an algorithm, that will return the length of the chain. The program should halt when the number reaches less than or equal to 1.

Example:
Input: 13
Output: 10
Explanantion:
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms.
