Challenge: 32

Determine the number of distinct pairs of elements in the array that sum up to the target value.
Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are considered to be distinct if and only if the values in sorted order do not match i.e. (1, 9) and (9, 1) are indistinct but (1, 9) and (9, 2) are distinct.

For Example, given the array [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1] and a target value of 10, the seven pairs (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 1) and (1, 9) all sum to 10 and there are only three distinct pairs: (1, 9), (2, 8), and (3, 7).
